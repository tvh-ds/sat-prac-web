# Grit SAT practice

Grit helps admins prepare SAT practice and full-length tests, assign work to
students, and track completion and results. Students receive their own assigned
test copies and complete them in the student workspace.

## Student classes

Admins form named classes under Students → Classes, find students by name or
email, and manage membership. A student can belong to multiple classes. Empty
classes can be prepared before members are added.

The assignment dialog supports individual students or a class. Class assignment
sends work to every current member; an empty class cannot receive work. Each
class shows its assigned practice sets and full-length tests with links to the
assignment results. Class labels identify the destination in assignment views.

Assignments preserve the recipients and class name recorded when assigned.
Later membership changes and renaming do not alter past work. Class membership
and administration remain visible only to admins.

Practice timers accept whole-number minutes from 1 through 600. The field can
be cleared while editing; validation happens when saving or assigning.

## Design and release constraints

Extend the existing Grit visual identity described in DESIGN.md. Keep the dense
operational tables, readable controls, navy surfaces, and champagne actions.
Wide tables scroll inside their own surface on narrow screens.

Staging uses local, unpushed code and Supabase project wgkggknyndgaoyazdhdf.
Production deployment requires an explicit publishing or push request.
